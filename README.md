Install Firefox Developer Edition

This script automates the process of:

1.  Downloading Firefox Developer Edition
2.  Extracting everything to */usr/lib64/firefox-developer-edition*
3.  Building a proper **.desktop** application shortcut

For best results, run the script as your local user in order to create the shortcut in *~/.local/share/applications*.  Mid-way through, you will need to input your password for [sudo] privilege to install to */usr/lib64*

As with any random script you find online, inspect it first to ensure no harm to your machine.
